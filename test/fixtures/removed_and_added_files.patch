+# RME (or whatever the name is)
+
+It's **just** a review board for git based projects, nothing more.
+
+It's split in two components, the web interface and a command line tool, both working togheter. The idea is to be more simpler possible and avoid extra useles steps.
+
+## Create a merge request
+
+1. Do your job, i.e. code!
+2. Commit it to git
+3. It's ready for review? then just call `rme` command.
+
+Done, it's it. Your review will be created and the rme command will tell you the URL used for review.
+
+## Updating a merge request
+
+1. Update your patch (git commit --amend)
+2. call `rme` command.
+
+Done.
+
+## Accepting a merge request
+
+1. Go to web interface and click accept.
+
+Done, Rme will try to apply and commit your patch, it will tell you if it can't. And if it can't, just send another 
+
+## How to setup rme command line interface
+
+1. Register your projecy in the web interface.
+2. go to the directory where your project workign copy is.
+3. type the command you saw in the web interface.
+
+Done.
+
+## Telling on what branch the patch should go
+
+Use the syntax: `rme on <branch>`
+
+# Wish list
+
+1. lint support
+2. CI integration
+3. Way to review resolution of merge conflicts.
